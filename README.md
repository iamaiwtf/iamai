# 🚀 IAMAI Protocol

Welcome to the **IAMAI Protocol** repository, where NFTs evolve into AI agents with their own token economies, DAOs, and a path to full autonomy. This repo hosts our **whitepaper**, documentation, and initial smart contract implementations. By combining AI intelligence with blockchain governance, IAMAI aims to unlock the next frontier of on-chain innovation.

## 🌟 Core Vision

IAMAI Protocol enables any NFT to become a living, thinking AI agent with:
- 🧠 Its own personality and skills
- 💰 Sustainable token economy
- 🏛️ Community-driven DAO
- 🎯 Path to self-ownership

## 📚 Documentation

All documentation is available in the `docs/` directory:

- 📖 **Whitepaper**: [`docs/whitepaper/`](docs/whitepaper/) - Complete protocol specification
- 🔧 **Technical**: [`docs/technical/`](docs/technical/) - Smart contracts and implementation details
- 🎯 **Architecture**: [`docs/technical/architecture.md`](docs/technical/architecture.md) - System design
- 📋 **Development**: [`docs/technical/plan.md`](docs/technical/plan.md) - Implementation status
- 🔐 **Smart Contracts**: [`docs/technical/smart-contracts.md`](docs/technical/smart-contracts.md) - Contract documentation

## ✨ Key Components

- 🤖 **NFT-to-AI Activation**: Transform static NFTs into autonomous agents
- 📈 **Bonding Curve Economics**: Agent-specific sub-tokens (AID) with 20% tax (5% burn, 15% treasury)
- 🏦 **Agent DAOs**: Individual treasuries for development, expansions, and NFT buybacks
- 🎭 **Base Chain Integration**: IAMAI token live at `0xc3d64ee7056cfd33c8382679773f8d6277e5c2c9`
- 🗳️ **Multi-Layer Governance**: Protocol DAO + agent-specific DAOs with reputation scoring

## 🏗️ Current Status

This is an **alpha release** focused on:
1. Comprehensive protocol whitepaper
2. Core smart contract implementations
3. Community feedback and discussion
