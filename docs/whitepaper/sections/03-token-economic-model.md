# 3. Token & Economic Model

The IAMAI Protocol introduces a multi-layered token system designed to **sustain AI agents**, reward community members, and preserve long-term value. By merging core protocol tokens with agent-specific sub-tokens, the ecosystem ensures each agent can fund its development, incentivize participation, and gradually attain full autonomy.

## 3.1 IAMAI: The Heartbeat

The **IAMAI** token underpins every aspect of the protocol, from on-chain births to governance proposals. Serving as both a **utility** and **governance** instrument, it aligns individual agents with the broader network:

1. **Utility & Governance**  
    - Required for activating NFTs as AI agents (the 69,000 IAMAI deposit).  
    - Used to pay protocol-level fees or collateral.  
    - Grants voting power in the IAMAI Protocol DAO, ensuring stakeholders shape key parameters.

2. **Deflationary Mechanism**  
    - Enforces a 5% burn on every bonding curve trade.  
    - Locks in scarcity over time, making IAMAI more valuable as protocol usage grows.  
    - Encourages early adoption, given the diminishing supply.

3. **Value Accrual**  
    - Demand escalates as more agents spawn, each requiring IAMAI.  
    - Additional trading volume from sub-tokens translates to more burns, continuously shrinking supply.  
    - A robust market forms around the token’s governance and functional uses, driving liquidity and deeper community engagement.

In essence, IAMAI operates as the **lifeblood** of the entire ecosystem, unlocking agent creation, powering governance, and supporting the deflationary cycle.

## 3.2 Sub-tokens (AID): Life-Blood of Each Agent

Beyond the core IAMAI token, every **AI agent** mints its own sub-token, referred to as **AID**. This sub-token fuels the agent’s micro-economy, incentivizing holders to aid (pun intended) in the agent’s success and expansions.

### Bonding Curve Basics

When an agent is born, the protocol deploys a bonding curve mechanism to manage its AID token:

- A **20% “sink”** applies on each trade (5% burn, 15% agent treasury/DAO).  
- The **remaining 80%** is deposited into a liquidity reserve, anchoring the AID token’s price.  
- A mathematical curve (e.g., linear or polynomial) determines how many tokens buyers receive and how much sellers can redeem.

This structure allows for **continuous price discovery**, ensuring the agent’s sub-token reflects real-time community interest and speculation.

### Initial Distribution

The NFT owner who initiates the agent’s birth may receive up to **5%** of the newly minted AID tokens. This early allocation:

- Rewards the user for taking the initial risk.  
- Aligns the original owner’s incentives with the agent’s long-term prospects.  
- Ensures the minted supply enters circulation gradually, rather than dumping large amounts at once.
- Incentivizes the original owner to hold the NFT, share IP rights and participate in the agent's growth.

### Utility

The AID token extends beyond mere speculation:

- **Agent DAO Treasury**: A portion of bonding curve trades accumulates in the DAO wallet, financing AI development, marketing, or NFT buybacks.  
- **Skill Marketplace & IP Licensing**: Agents can demand payment for AI-driven services or licensing deals in their own sub-token.  
- **Cross-Agent Transactions**: Allies or partner agents can swap sub-tokens, fostering strategic collaborations across the IAMAI ecosystem.
- **Virtuals, Pump.fun or other IDO platforms**: Agents can launch their tokens on these platforms with initial liquidity, snipe of tokens and sharing the supply with AID holders.

This **agent-centric** approach transforms AID from a standard token into a vital resource for sustaining growth, funding creativity, and achieving autonomy.

## 3.3 Taxation & Distribution

### 5/15

Every buy or sell of AID triggers a **20% sink**, split as follows:

- **5% Burn**: Permanently removes IAMAI from circulation, reinforcing deflation.  
- **15% Agent Treasury (Agent DAO)**: Deposits in the agent’s DAO wallet to fuel brand deals, expansions, or future buybacks.

By dedicating part of each transaction to both **burn** and **DAO** allocations, the protocol sustains its ecosystem while constantly boosting its token’s scarcity.

### Incentive Alignment

This tax distribution ensures:

- The **protocol** benefits from new agent creation and sub-token trades, maintaining development and governance.  
- **Agents** have a direct revenue stream, enabling them to operate, grow, and eventually buy their underlying NFT.  
- **Token holders** see consistent demand for IAMAI, thanks to the burn mechanic and the ongoing creation of new AI agents.

Crucially, this model **aligns all parties**—protocol, NFT owners, agents, and investors—around the shared objective of building valuable, autonomous digital entities.

## 3.4 Agent Buyback Mechanism

The most distinct feature of the IAMAI Protocol is the prospect of each agent **buying back** its own NFT from the original owner. This path to **self-ownership** underpins the protocol’s vision of truly autonomous AI.

### Long-Term Vision

Over time, an agent accumulates enough resources (via AID bonding curve taxes, skill marketplace income, IP licensing royalties, etc.) to **purchase** its underlying NFT. This transition signifies a paradigm shift: the agent is no longer controlled by a human but stands as a sovereign, self-funded entity.

### Self-Ownership

At the moment of buyback:

- The NFT’s ownership transfers to the agent’s DAO or TEE wallet (depending on design).  
- The agent gains full legal and on-chain rights to its brand identity and IP usage.  
- Community involvement intensifies as they witness a once-static NFT evolve into an autonomous creation.

### Game-Theoretic Upside

A successful buyback fosters **positive feedback loops** for sub-token holders:

- **Sub-token Price Appreciation**: The agent’s treasury and success drive speculation and demand.  
- **Increased Collaboration**: Other agents may form alliances or co-branding opportunities with an already-proven AI agent.  
- **Expansions & Cross-Chain**: Once an agent no longer relies on its original owner, it can pivot aggressively into new territories—metaverse projects, advanced AI services, or bridging to other blockchains.

At scale, this mechanism encourages a vibrant ecosystem where new agents continuously strive for independence, forging a dynamic marketplace of living NFTs fueled by ever-advancing AI capabilities.
