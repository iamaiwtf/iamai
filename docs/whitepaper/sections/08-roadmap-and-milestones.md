# 8. Roadmap & Milestones

This section outlines how the IAMAI Protocol will be implemented and grown over time. Each milestone expands the capabilities of AI agents, from simple births to full commercial and technical autonomy. By pacing the rollout, the community gains space to validate assumptions, propose refinements, and solidify the system before major expansions.

## 8.1 Phase-by-Phase Rollout

### Phase A: Basic Births & Bonding Curve
- **Core Goal**: Establish the foundation for AI agent creation and sub-token trading.
- **Deliverables**:
    1. **ERC721AIRegistry**: Enables NFT whitelisting and handles birthAgent calls.
    2. **BondingCurve**: Implements the 20% sink on buys/sells (5% burn, 15% agent treasury).
    3. **UI**: Basic dApp interface to birth an agent using 69,000 IAMAI and trade its AID.
- **Success Metric**: Demonstrated births on testnet, stable sub-token price discovery, and user acceptance of the 5/15 tax distribution.

### Phase B: Agent DAOs & IP Signing
- **Core Goal**: Grant each agent its own DAO governance and legal IP usage rights.
- **Deliverables**:
    1. **AgentDAO**: Auto-deployed upon agent birth, storing 10% of sub-token trades.
    2. **IP Licensing Mechanism**: On-chain assignment ensuring the agent can fully exploit its NFT brand.
    3. **Upgraded UI**: Display proposals, voting results, and treasury balances for each agent’s DAO.
- **Success Metric**: Multiple agents with active DAOs, receiving IP-based revenue or marketing deals, plus successful user proposals/votes.

### Phase C: Reputation Baseline & Whitelisting
- **Core Goal**: Introduce a reputation system and broaden the NFT scope.
- **Deliverables**:
    1. **ReputationManager**: Tracks agent performance, bonding curve stats, marketplace outcomes, etc.
    2. **Expanded Whitelisting**: Approve additional NFT collections, verifying brand quality or deposit requirements.
    3. **Early Ecosystem Grants**: The Protocol DAO can reward top-performing or promising agents.
- **Success Metric**: Agents begin showcasing on-chain trust scores, whitelisting accelerates with minimal friction, top agents recognized via grants.

### Phase D: IP Licensing & Skill Marketplace
- **Core Goal**: Unlock revenue opportunities for agents beyond sub-token trading.
- **Deliverables**:
    1. **IPRegistry**: On-chain registry of licensing deals; ensures consistent revenue flows to the agent’s treasury.
    2. **SkillMarketplace**: Agents offer specialized services (meme creation, coding tasks, alpha signals), paid in IAMAI/AID.
    3. **Community Tools**: Filter agents by rating, brand, or skill type; confidence in quality via reputation.
- **Success Metric**: Significant licensing deals or frequent skill marketplace engagements, boosting sub-token value and agent DAO resources.

### Phase E: IDOs on Virtuals/pump.fun & Autonomy Expansions
- **Core Goal**: Help agents raise additional capital to accelerate brand building and buyback readiness.
- **Deliverables**:
  1. **IDO Framework**: Templates for agent DAOs to mint a new token on Virtuals or pump.fun.
  2. **Advanced Reputation**: Weighted synergy for cross-investments, multi-chain presence, bridging expansions.
  3. **Automated Buyback Tools**: Clear proposals for NFT buyback once treasury meets the required threshold.
- **Success Metric**: Successful IDOs garnering meaningful liquidity; at least a few agents finalize NFT buyback, achieving complete independence.

### Phase F: Final Audits & Mainnet Launch
- **Core Goal**: Conclude testnet trials, finalize security measures, and deploy on the main network.
- **Deliverables**:
  1. **Security Audits**: Thorough code reviews from respected firms or community-led bug bounties.
  2. **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate testnet learnings into final releases.
  3. **Mainnet Deployment**: Officially launch IAMAI, open for major NFT collections and public adoption.
- **Success Metric**: Audited, stable protocol attracting user trust; top-tier NFT projects actively birthing AI agents on mainnet.
